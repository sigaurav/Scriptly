Upgrade Help
============

This document exists to help document changes between versions of Scriptly and
what existing bootstrap projects may need to migrate to recent versions.
The official changelog for releases is curated in
`github releases <https://github.com/scriptly/Scriptly/releases>`_, which will
document any major changes. Though every attempt is made to test upgrades, it
is recommended to backup your database prior to an upgrade in case your particular
usage of Scriptly is not something the creators test. If an error arises, please open
an `issue <https://github.com/scriptly/issues>`_ on github.

General Upgrade Information
---------------------------

As with all app upgrades, after installing a newer version, you should ensure
the app models are up to date with `python manage.py migrate`. Generally, this
command should be baked in with the startup script of your webserver to ensure
no instance is running with unapplied migrations.

Upgrading to 0.14
-----------------

This is largely a cleanup and deprecation release.

1) Support for versions of Django less than 3.2 are dropped. This removed quite a few functions
and requires modifying several files listed in later steps.

2) The minimum supported Python version is 3.7. For supporting scripts written
in older versions of Python, one approach is to create a docker wrapper, such
as in :ref:`docker_scripts`.

3) The function ugettext_lazy has been removed in Django 3.2 as the unicode/string
representation is no longer relevant in python3. Thus, all uses of this should be
replaced with gettext_lazy (one will be in `scriptly_settings.py`).

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

  becomes

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

4) `django-celery-results` has been removed from Scriptly as its tasks do not require a backend.
This should be removed from `INSTALLED_APPS` in `user_settings.py`.

5) In `user_urls.py`, the `url` import should be removed (this was an unused import and is no longer
a function in Django3.2+).

This entire line should be removed:

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls import include, url

6) In `django_urls.py`, `url` should instead be replaced with `re_path`.

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls import include, url
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        url(r'^accounts/logout/$', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
    ]

  becomes

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import include, re_path
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        re_path(r'^accounts/logout/$', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
    ]

7) In `scriptly_urls.py`, `url` also needs to be changed to `path`.

  .. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += [
        #url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        url(r'^', include('scriptly.urls')),
    ]


  becomes

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns += [
        # path('admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        path("", include("scriptly.urls")),
        path("", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
    ]

8) If you were using a S3 bucket, you likely need to upgrade `django-storages`. You may need to change
the `AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH` settings from `False` to `True` to comply with recent changes to S3.

9) Celery settings have been changed to coincide with the upcoming configuration change. Please review
`Celery Configuration <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html>`_ to evaluate
what names need to be remapped. In `scriptly_celery_app.py`, you should remove the `namespace=CELERY` line
after making appropiate changes.

0.9.11 To 0.10
--------------

0.10 adds in support for Django 1.10 as well as Django 1.11. Django versions
prior to 1.8 are no longer officially supported.

1) *Celery Changes*:
    Celery was upgraded to version 4.x and several changes are required:

    1) First, celery is no longer executed through

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py celery

        but instead via:

        .. code-block:: python

            celery -A your_project_name worker -l info (and any other arguments)

    2) Because `django-celery` is now deprecated and incompatible with newer Django and Celery versions,
       several settings in `settings/user_settings.py` must be updated:

        .. code-block:: python

            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'djcelery',
                'kombu.transport.django',
            )

       must be changed to:

        .. code-block:: python

            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'django_celery_results',
                'kombu.transport.filesystem',
            )

       If the django-celery task result backend was in use, the backend must be changed from:

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'djcelery.backends.database:DatabaseBackend'

       to:

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'django-db'

       If a broker was never specified, the default broker url must be changed from

        .. code-block:: python

            BROKER_URL = 'django://'

       to

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'filesystem://'
            # This function exists just to ensure the filesystem has the correct folders
            def ensure_path(path):
                import errno
                try:
                    os.makedirs(path)
                except Exception as e:
                    if e.errno == errno.EEXIST:
                        pass
                    else:
                        raise
                return path

            broker_dir = ensure_path(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.broker'))
            CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {
                "data_folder_in": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "out")),
                "data_folder_out": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "out")),
                "data_folder_processed": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "processed")),
            }

      *Note*: It is **highly** recommended to not use this broker and use something such as rabbitmq or redis.

    3) The celery app instance, located in `your_project_name/scriptly_celery_app.py` must be updated to:

        .. code-block:: python

            from __future__ import absolute_import
            import os

            from celery import Celery


            os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')

            app = Celery('your_project_name')

            # Using a string here means the worker will not have to
            # pickle the object when using Windows.
            app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
            app.autodiscover_tasks()

            @app.task(bind=True)
            def debug_task(self):
                print('Request: {0!r}'.format(self.request))

2) *Django Upgrades*:
    Additional tweaks may be required for if a Django upgrade is performed, such as
    changing `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` to `MIDDLEWARE`. For these issues, the official
    `Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_ should be referenced.
